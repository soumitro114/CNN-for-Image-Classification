# CNN-for-Image-Classification
The final project for Machine learning/Deep learning course. Using tensorflow to create a Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) for cat/dog recognition.

In this project, we are going to build up a convolutional neural network (CNN) to be trained on training dataset (including 4000 images of 
dog and 4000 images of cat), and then be tested on the test dataset including 1000 images of dog and 1000 images of cat (for the sake of 
evaluation). Finally, you are supposed to input your model with images in "single_prediction" folder in order to classify the image as 
a dog or cat (making prediction using your model).
